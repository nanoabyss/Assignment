            <h2>Chill vibes spots maps</h2>
            <P>Chill spots map was a university project in which I was tasked with creating a brochure of my choice of topic.
                The brochure included a map showing all the location of the chill vibes spots. The map of the locations
                was based in nicholls in the upper north of canberra. This project was my real first experience with design
                so it is not the best. The goal of this work was just to expand my skill set.
            </P>
            <div id = "Hummus-Doc">
                <h2>Documentation</h2>
                For this project there was a couple of stages that were required for the idea to be fully developed. 
                The first stage was to develop a layout system for the entire map. 
                This was broken down into two main sections: 
                <br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Individual page layout</li>
                    <li>Overall Layout</li>
                </ul>
                <h5>Individual Page Layout</h5>
                The individual page layout followed the design of being split into two main sections. 
                The first section being a zoomed in section of the map and photos of the location. 
                The next section contained the location name, information about the location and different types of rating for the location. 
                This was the first idea generated it was kept due to the information being in an organised manner and appealing to the eye.
                <h5>Overall Layout</h5>
                The overall layout had six location pages in a row so the user could see the locations easier. 
                The map being on the back was chosen because it allowed the user to see the entire map, while keeping the display method interesting.
                <br>
                <h5>Folding System & Colour Palette</h5>
                The next stage was looking for a folding system that I felt best matched the goal of the project. 
                I decided on a certain folding system I just cannot find which folding system that was. 
                <br>
                The next stage was deciding on the colour to be used, which took inspiration from the Vaporwave aesthetics. 
                The reason behind the focus on the VaporWave aesthetic was at the time I was really into that aesthetic so based this assignment around it.
                <br>

                <br>
                Then the last stage then figuring out the map design for this I conducted research on different types of map design. I discovered these three
                <div class="image-row" id ="chill-spots-image-row">
                    <div class = "image-row-div">
                        <img src="../Work-Projects/Vibe spots/design1.png">
                        <div class = "image-row-item">
                            <p>Design 1</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class = "image-row-div">
                        <img src="../Work-Projects/Vibe spots/design2.png">
                        <div class = "image-row-item">
                            <p>Design 2</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class = "image-row-div">
                        <img src="../Work-Projects/Vibe spots/design3.png">
                        <div class = "image-row-item">
                            <p>Design 3</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
                With this three designs in mind I designed my map to contain similar design features. These design features can be seen in the final map brochure below.
