            <h2>Eating Energy</h2>
            <p> Eating Energy was a group project created by myself and Gwen during our university studies to explore
                the energy consumption by Australian states then broken down by energy types.
                Then from the energy consumed to create a hummus recipe that represented the amount of energy type
                that was consumed. If a fossil fuel was used a bad tasting ingredient was added, if a renewable
                energy was used a good tasting ingredient was added to the recipe. The goal of this project was
                to physically express the energy consumption of each Australian State, so people could understand
                how much fossil fuel vs renewable energy was used.</p>
