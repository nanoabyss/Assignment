            <h2>Dynamic Identity</h2>
            <p>Dynamic Identity was a group university project with the goal of creating a dynamic identity for the
                National Arboretum Canberra. The dynamic identity included a couple of Outputs that the National Arboretum Canberra
                could use for their identity, like new logos and social media profile pictures. Their identity that we created
                had to be dynamic meaning they could generate a new logo if they desired. This project was created in
                p5.js using JavaScript.

                        <h2>Documentation</h2>
                        Dynamic Identities was a group project completed during university. For the group we split the work up between us, 
                        the work was split in the following way.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Kyle: Coding, Code Planning, mock-ups and research.</li>
                            <li>Ahmaz: Coding, implementing the p5.svg.js library to manipulate SVGs and research.</li>
                            <li>Yasmin: Coding, stylistic choices, research, hand generated sketches and mock-ups.</li>

                        </ul>
                        The first step of the project was developing an initial sketch of The National Arboretum from a bird-eyes view.
                        <br>

                            <div class = "image-row-div">
                                <img src="../Work-Projects/Dynamic Identity/inital1.PNG">
                                <div class = "image-row-item">
                                    <p>Sktech 1</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                            <div class = "image-row-div">
                                <img src="../Work-Projects/Dynamic Identity/inital2.PNG">
                                <div class = "image-row-item">
                                    <p>Sketch 2</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                        From this revised sketch we took elements to create the generative/dynamic identity. Like all the different line types and dots. 
                        <h3>Stylistic decisions</h3>
                        Once the sketch was completed, we moved onto the decision about fonts and colour palette. 
                        For this, 4 colour palettes were generated to represent all the seasons as a goal of the project was to represent the season in the identity. 
                        We also decided upon the font to be used for the identity.
                        The next stage of the project and the longest was the code development inside p5.js to create dynamic identities.
                        There is little documentation of the process on this stage as we just iterated on inside p5.js to create the final product.

                        The final stage was generating a report as part of the assignment, I did not contribute a lot to this section as I was mainly coding and creating the dynamic identity. But a link copy of the report can be found here:
