                <h2> Data Visualisations</h2>
                <p>
                    Like JS experiment this assignment was mainly for the use of developing our skills and applying skills we have learnt in class to a project.
                    <br>
                    <h2>Documentation</h2>
                    For the design process it started with the collection of data that would be required for data visualization. 
                    The data that was used was gathered from a couple sources as there are three different visualizations. 
                    I cannot exactly remember where all the sources of the data come from. 
                    The first data was air quality for different cities, the next data visualisation is the Australian exchange rate to different currencies and finally the last data was the unemployment rate by states. 
                   <br>
                    From all these data sources we can see that there was the similar theme of data sources that have a lot of available data.
                    For the visualization design process there was not a lot as most of it was just iteration of the code until a final version that was achieved. 
                    There was no predefined colour palette, no predefined fonts or anything similar. 
                    This was mainly since the focus was more on the technical aspect of the data visualisation not the aesthetics.
                    I also think it was in part due to the fact that this was one of my earlier design classes, so I was still getting a grasp on the design process.
