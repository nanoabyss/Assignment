            <h1>Reflection</h1>
            <p>Overall I have learnt a couple of things making this website but I had previous experience making a website
                so a lot of this isn’t new to me, its just rehashing old skills and creating a new design layout.
                But there are still a couple of things that I learnt or had to change my old perspective on it to
                the correct way of doing it.
                <br>
                <br>
                The first one not uploading the highest resolution of images if they are not the focus of the page.
                I didn’t really use this knowledge because the only real uses of images I had in my website was a
                personal photography gallery in which the images needed to be high resolution because they are the
                focus of the page.
                <br>
                <br>
                A skill I learnt while doing this course was how to create a lightbox carousel for my photography.
                In order to do this, I had to learn JavaScript. Learning JavaScript was helpful because used it in the
                last part of the assignment to create a toggle button to change the CSS of a page.
                <br>
                <br>
                One thing I would do differently was to create the final navigation bar at the start of the project and
                not to add anything to it as finish the website. I didn’t do this, and I always had to go back to the
                navigation bar’s on all my pages and update them. This took a bit of time and overall was just a waste
                of time, instead I should have finalised at the start. Same goes for the footer.
                <br>
                <br>
                Similar to the last one, if I was to create this website again, I would have created all the pages at
                the start, like a skeleton and fill them out as they were due. Instead of creating pages during the
                process and having to change other pages to link to them.
                <br>
                <br>
                Another thing I learnt is that is very helpful is to have a single CSS file instead of having a couple
                as you just update one CSS file and it affects the whole website which saves a lot of time.
                <br>
                <br>
                Overall I learnt a couple things throughout this website development process which will be helpful.
