                Hello
                <br>
                <br>
                Iâ€™m Kyle a 4th year Commerce and Design student at ANU. During my time at university, I have created numerous things
                through my design degree. This website will be an e portfolio to show my design work that I have completed at ANU.
                It will also include personal projects and hopefully future personal project. The website will also have a resume
                section to show my work experience that I have gathered at school and university.
                <br>
                <br>
                The mission of this assignment and website is to create something that I will use for the foreseeable future to
                display my work and possibly help me get a job. For this I will need a section to show off my work at university and
                personal work. I will also need a section to display an online resume. That could either be just a text on a page or
                something more interactive. This website will also need to help sell me to a possible employer.

                The goals of this website are:
            </p>
            <div class = "Container-Passion">
                <ul>
                    <li>Develop my coding skills further</li>
                    <li> Develop my design skills further </li>
                    <li> Create a foundation e portfolio that I can update as I create more things </li>
                    <li> Create a foundation of a website to build upon as my coding knowledge increases. </li>
                    <li> Express that I would be a good employee. </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
